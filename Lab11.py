# Welcome everyone! This is just a template I started for the lab.
# Please feel free to change anything. I thought this might help 
# keep us organized, but please share any ideas you have for 
# this lab.

# Please note that any code you see in my section is mostly just
# for my own practice and not meant as a basis for how we should 
# code this project together.
